## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added an opt-in per-provider `allowPrivateHttp` flag that permits plain `http:` base URLs on private-network IPv4 addresses (RFC 1918). Default is off; public hosts and metadata-service hosts are unchanged.

### Fixed
- Restrict the IPv4 loopback exception to actual IP addresses instead of hostnames beginning with `127.`.
- Use local TypeScript dependencies and synchronize the lockfile with existing dependency overrides so a fresh clone can run checks.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Prepared `pi-model-discovery` package metadata, README, changelog, license, package ignore rules, and local-extension git readiness for public release review.
